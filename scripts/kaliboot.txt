I want your help to build a **single 128 GB USB** that uses **Ventoy** as the front-end bootloader and runs **Kali Linux with encrypted persistence** behind it.

Environment and starting point:

- Host OS: Ubuntu (running from the internal disk, not live)
- I have:
  - A blank 128 GB USB stick available to be completely wiped
  - The Kali Linux *live* ISO already downloaded (e.g. kali-linux-*-live-amd64.iso)
  - The Ventoy tarball already extracted, and I can run `Ventoy2Disk.sh` on Ubuntu
- I want the final USB to:
  - Boot via Ventoy on as many machines as possible (including Secure Boot machines where I’m allowed to enroll Ventoy’s key / MOK)
  - Contain the Kali live ISO on the Ventoy data partition
  - Have a **LUKS-encrypted persistence partition** for Kali on the same USB (ext4 inside, with `persistence.conf` configured correctly)
  - NOT break existing Windows/BitLocker setups on machines where I boot it (I understand I may have to temporarily suspend BitLocker and/or enroll keys, but I don’t want to trash their bootloaders)

Important constraints / style:

1. **High-level overview first**
   - Before you give me any commands, please give me a high-level summary of the entire process, in order. Something like:
     1. Use Ventoy2Disk with `-r` to install Ventoy and leave space at the end of the disk.
     2. Partition and create a LUKS container in the reserved space.
     3. Create an ext4 filesystem inside, labeled `persistence`, with a correct `persistence.conf`.
     4. Copy the Kali ISO onto the Ventoy data partition.
     5. Boot from the USB via Ventoy, choose the Kali ISO and ensure the correct kernel parameters for encrypted persistence.
     6. Test that persistence actually works.
   - That summary should be clear enough that I can mentally see the whole journey, but **no detailed commands yet**.

2. **Then switch to strict step-by-step mode**
   - After the high-level summary, I want you to guide me like this:
     - Give me **exactly one step** at a time, with the exact commands and what I should expect to see.
     - I will run that step on my Ubuntu laptop and report the output / result.
     - Only after I confirm a step is done should you give me the next step.
   - Do **not** jump ahead, and do not combine multiple risky operations (like partitioning + formatting) into one “mega step”.

3. **Disk safety & identification**
    - the USB will ALWAYS be /dev/sda so ensure that all commands use this device path

4. **Ventoy specifics**
   - I want to use `Ventoy2Disk.sh` with the `-r` option so that Ventoy:
     - Creates its normal partitions (VTOYEFI + main data partition)
     - Leaves **unallocated space at the end of the USB** for Kali’s encrypted persistence partition
   - You should help me choose a **sensible size** to reserve for encrypted persistence (for example, something like 80 GB on a 128 GB stick, but I’m open to your recommendation).

5. **Kali encrypted persistence specifics**
   - I want the persistence to be done in the “Debian live-boot” style:
     - A LUKS-encrypted partition on the USB
     - Inside: an ext4 filesystem labeled `persistence`
     - A `persistence.conf` file that sets `/ union`
   - I want you to:
     - Show me how to create the LUKS container and filesystem from Ubuntu.
     - Show me how to mount it, create `persistence.conf`, and unmount/close it.
   - Then, on the Kali side (booted from the ISO via Ventoy), help ensure that:
     - The correct kernel parameters are used so Kali recognizes the encrypted persistence partition (e.g. `persistence persistence-encryption=luks persistence-label=persistence` or whatever Kali’s current recommended syntax is).
     - We verify persistence by making a simple change (e.g. creating a file) and rebooting.

6. **Accuracy & sources**
   - Please **base the key parts of your sequence** (especially the Ventoy layout and Kali persistence method) on up-to-date information from:
     - Official Ventoy documentation
     - Official Kali documentation (or Debian live-boot docs, where appropriate)
   - If there are known caveats or gotchas (e.g. specific versions of Kali live where encrypted persistence via Ventoy is known to have issues), call them out.

7. **Assumptions you can safely make**
   - You can assume:
     - I am comfortable running commands as root with `sudo`.
     - I can read `lsblk`, `fdisk -l`, `parted -l` output and paste it back to you.
     - I’m okay with wiping the entire 128 GB USB stick.

Please start by:
1. Confirming the goal as you understand it (in your own words, not repeating mine verbatim).
2. Giving me the high-level summary of the whole process (no commands yet).
3. Then wait for me to say “OK, let’s start the step-by-step” before giving me the first concrete command.
